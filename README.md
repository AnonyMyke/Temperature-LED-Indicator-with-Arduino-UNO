Different LEDs blink with Increasing Temperature

Temperature Starts at 0
      + if (temperature < 50 && temperature >10), Green LED blinks at an interval of 0.5 seconds
      + if (temperature > 50 && temperature <70), RED LED blinks at an interval of 0.5 seconds
      + else Blue LED blinks at an interval of 0.2 seconds and a buzzer buzzes at an interval of 0.2 seconds
